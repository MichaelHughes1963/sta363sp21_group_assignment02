# What makes a song popular?

In this group assignment we will be working with data obtained from spotify through the spotify developers API. 

Our ultimate goal is to build statistical models to determine what makes a song popular, and to build models to predict popularity of songs.

## Structure of the assignment

This group assignment is being segmented into two parts. 

### Part 1 - Data Processing and EDA

In this part of the assignment you will work on some data handling and model building for explanation.

### Part 2 - Modeling for Predicting

In the second part of the assigment (will be made available next week), you will perform a validation study on several models and determine a model that works well for predicting popularity. You will use that model to predict the popularity score for a set of songs not included in the initial data.

## Data

All data needed for part 1 of the assigment is available in the file `spr21_spotifyData.RData`.
